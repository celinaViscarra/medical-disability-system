## Tech Stack
This app is completely responsive.

For this app it was used the authentication that it's given by *Firebase.* The authentication is by email and password. For the moment, it isn't allowed to sign up by other method or by any social network.

For the backend it was made in *Firestore*, in there are the collections that control, save and bring the information to the app.

The creation was made with *create-react-app*.

The manage of status was doing completly doing with hooks. The most used hook was *the state hook* and *the use effect hook*.

## The Style
The style was managed with *scss*, this decision wasn't made by choice, in the development of this project appear a problem with de *css* files, so the solution was to transform that files to *scss*.

Also, it was used some *style components, react-toastify, bootstrap and bootswatch*. Not all of them were use in the same files, the project is a full combination of all of that.
